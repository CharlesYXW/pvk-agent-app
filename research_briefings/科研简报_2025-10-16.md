**摘要:**

> Temporal graph classification plays a critical role in applications such as cybersecurity, brain connectivity analysis, social dynamics, and traffic monitoring. Despite its significance, this problem remains underexplored compared to temporal link prediction or node forecasting. Existing methods often rely on snapshot-based or recurrent architectures that either lose fine-grained temporal information or struggle with long-range dependencies. Moreover, local message-passing approaches suffer from oversmoothing and oversquashing, limiting their ability to capture complex temporal structures.   We introduce T3former, a novel Topological Temporal Transformer that leverages sliding-window topological and spectral descriptors as first-class tokens, integrated via a specialized Descriptor-Attention mechanism. This design preserves temporal fidelity, enhances robustness, and enables principled cross-modal fusion without rigid discretization. T3former achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, including dynamic social networks, brain functional connectivity datasets, and traffic networks. It also offers theoretical guarantees of stability under temporal and structural perturbations. Our results highlight the power of combining topological and spectral insights for advancing the frontier of temporal graph learning.

**摘要:**

> Exotic electronic physics including correlated insulating states and fractional Chern insulators have been observed in twisted bilayer graphene in a magnetic field when the Fermi velocity vanishes, however a question remains as to the stability of these states which is controlled by the gap to the first excited state. Free-space terahertz magneto-optics can directly probe the gap to charge excitations which bounds the stability of electronic states, but this measurement has thus-far been inaccessible due to the micron size of twisted bilayer graphene samples, while the wavelength of terahertz light is up to a millimeter. Here we leverage advances in fabrication to create twisted bilayer graphene samples over 5 mm x 5 mm in size with a uniform twist angle and study the magnetic field dependence of the cyclotron resonance by a complex Faraday rotation experiment in p-doped large angle twisted bilayer graphene. These measurements directly probe charge excitations in inter-Landau level transitions and determine the Fermi velocity as a function of twist angle.

**摘要:**

> Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in interpreting complex medical imaging data. However, their significant computational and memory demands pose challenges for deployment in real-time, resource-constrained mobile and wearable devices used in clinical environments. We introduce, BiTMedViT, a new class of Edge ViTs serving as medical AI assistants that perform structured analysis of medical images directly on the edge. BiTMedViT utilizes ternary- quantized linear layers tailored for medical imaging and com- bines a training procedure with multi-query attention, preserving stability under ternary weights with low-precision activations. Furthermore, BiTMedViT employs task-aware distillation from a high-capacity teacher to recover accuracy lost due to extreme quantization. Lastly, we also present a pipeline that maps the ternarized ViTs to a custom CUDA kernel for efficient memory bandwidth utilization and latency reduction on the Jetson Orin Nano. Finally, BiTMedViT achieves 86% diagnostic accuracy (89% SOTA) on MedMNIST across 12 datasets, while reducing model size by 43x, memory traffic by 39x, and enabling 16.8 ms inference at an energy efficiency up to 41x that of SOTA models at 183.62 GOPs/J on the Orin Nano. Our results demonstrate a practical and scientifically grounded route for extreme-precision medical imaging ViTs deployable on the edge, narrowing the gap between algorithmic advances and deployable clinical tools.

## 4. Unified Origin of Dirac Neutrino and Asymmetric Dark Matter Masses via a Dirac-Type Leptogenesis

- **发布日期:** 2025-10-15
- **链接:** http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13723v1

**摘要:**

> We propose a simple and unified framework that simultaneously explains the origins of light Dirac neutrino masses, asymmetric dark matter (ADM), and the baryon asymmetry of the Universe. The model is based on an extended $U(1)_X$ Froggatt-Nielsen--like mechanism, which naturally generates suppressed Yukawa couplings and realizes a Dirac seesaw for neutrino masses. An additional $\mathbb{Z}_4$ symmetry stabilizes the dark sector, where chiral fermions charged under $\mathbb{Z}_4$ serve as ADM candidates. Leptogenesis occurs through the out-of-equilibrium decays of heavy Dirac neutrinos, where the generated asymmetry is shared between the visible and dark sectors due to exact lepton-number conservation. The same suppression mechanism that explains the smallness of neutrino masses also determines the GeV-scale ADM mass. Numerical studies demonstrate that a fully asymmetric DM scenario is realized, consistent with relic abundance, Big Bang nucleosynthesis, and direct detection constraints. This framework provides an experimentally testable connection between neutrino physics, dark matter, and baryogenesis within an anomaly-free setup.

**摘要:**

> The rapid advancement of Radio Frequency System-onChip (RFSoC) technology from Xilinx (AMD) has enabled the integration of high-speed data converters and programmable logic within a single package. RFSoC platforms are already widely adopted in telecommunications, radar, and satellite communications, where they promise reductions in system footprint and power consumption. However, their suitability for Low-Level RF (LLRF) control systems in accelerator environments - where stability requirements are critical - has not been quantitatively evaluated. This paper presents a comparative measurement-based assessment of RFSoC-based and conventional LLRF designs, focusing on signal fidelity, phase noise, latency, system complexity, and integration challenges. The advantages and challenges of adopting RFSoC-based direct conversion architectures are discussed, providing guidance for future LLRF system implementations.

**摘要:**

> To date, inorganic halide perovskite nanocrystals show promising contributions in emerging luminescent materials due to their high tolerance to defects. In particular, the development of cesium lead iodide (CsPbI3) has shown its efficiency for light-harvesting properties. However, further implementation is hindered due to the toxicity of the lead content. Therefore, in this study, we introduced Cu atoms to partially substitute Pb atoms (5% Cu) in the CsPbI3 lattice as a solution to reduce Pb toxicity. A partial lead material is substituted using Cu displays a larger Stokes shift (-67 nm) compared to the pristine, and resulted doped CsPbI3 not undergo the undesired self absorption. An outcome is focused on the champion of fast-component (tau_1) decay time ~0.6 ns. Temperature-dependent radioluminescence outlines an incremental change in the emission intensity is marginally centered at 713 +- 16 nm, which indicates Cu-doped CsPbI3 is not greatly affected by temperature. In addition, we report that the light yield (LY) pristine CsPbI3 after doping is increased to 3.0 +- 0.8 photons/keV. Our work provides physical insights into a tunable scintillation property using transition metal doping toward lead-free based scintillating perovskites.

**摘要:**

> Optical properties of the lead halide perovskites nanocrystals are controlled by confined excitons and rich spectrum of confined acoustic and optical phonons. We study experimentally and theoretically the exciton-phonon interaction in CsPbI3 perovskite nanocrystals embedded in a glass matrix. Energies of phonon modes allowed by selection rules are detected by resonant Raman scattering for nanocrystals with sizes of 4-13 nm, covering exciton energies of 1.72-2.25 eV. While optical phonon energies remain size-independent, the energies of confined acoustic phonons increase in smaller nanocrystals. Acoustic phonons are modeled within the continuum approximation using elastic constants computed by density functional theory. The model provides the energy spectra of confined phonons for nanocrystals of various shapes (cube, sphere, spheroid), crystal symmetries (orthorhombic and tetragonal), and sizes. Exciton confinement restricts efficient coupling to only few phonon modes observable in Raman spectra. By comparing experimental data with model predictions, we conclude that the nanocrystals in our samples predominantly have spherical or spheroidal shapes.

**摘要:**

> The role of data in modern materials science becomes more valuable and accurate when effects such as electron-phonon coupling and anharmonicity are included, providing a more realistic representation of finite-temperature material behavior. Furthermore, positional polymorphism, characterized by correlated local atomic disorder usually not reported by standard diffraction techniques, is a critical yet underexplored factor in understanding the electronic structure and transport properties of energy-efficient materials, like halide perovskites. In this manuscript, we present a first-principles methodology for locally disordered (polymorphous) cubic inorganic and hybrid halide perovskites, rooted in the special displacement method, that offers a systematic and alternative approach to molecular dynamics for exploring finite-temperature properties. By enabling a unified and efficient treatment of anharmonic lattice dynamics, electron-phonon coupling, and positional polymorphism, our approach generates essential data to predict temperature-dependent phonon properties, free energies, band gaps, and effective masses. Designed with a high-throughput spirit, this framework has been applied across a range of inorganic and hybrid halide perovskites: CsPbI3, CsPbBr3, CsSnI3, CsPbCl3, MAPbI3, MAPbBr3, MASnI3, MAPbCl3, FAPbI3, FAPbBr3, FASnI3, and FAPbCl3. We provide a comprehensive comparison between theoretical and experimental results and we systematically uncover trends and insights into their electronic and thermal behavior. For all compounds, we demonstrate strong and consistent correlations between local structural disorder, band gap openings, and effective mass enhancements.

## 9. Tracing Ion Migration in Halide Perovskites with Machine Learned Force Fields

**摘要:**

> Halide perovskite optoelectronic devices suffer from chemical degradation and current-voltage hysteresis induced by migration of highly mobile charged defects. Atomic scale molecular dynamics simulations can capture the motion of these ionic defects, but classical force fields are too inflexible to describe their dynamical charge states. Using CsPbI3 as a case study, we train machine learned force fields from density functional theory calculations and study the diffusion of charged halide interstitial and vacancy defects in bulk CsPbI3. We find that negative iodide interstitials and positive iodide vacancies, the most stable charge states for their respective defect type, migrate at similar rates at room temperature. Neutral interstitials are faster, but neutral vacancies are one order of magnitude slower. Oppositely charged interstitials and vacancies, as they can occur in device operation or reverse bias conditions, are significantly slower and can be considered relatively immobile.

**摘要:**

> The perovskite semiconductor, CsPbI3, holds excellent promise for solar cell applications due to its suitable bandgap. However, achieving phase-stable CsPbI3 solar cells with high power conversion efficiency remains a major challenge. Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) defects have been identified in a range of perovskite semiconductors, including CsPbI3. However, there is limited understanding as to why they form or their impact on stability and photophysical properties. Here we increase the prevalence of RP defects with increased Cs-excess in vapour-deposited CsPbI3 thin films and observe superior structural stability but inferior photophysical properties. Significantly, using electron microscopy, we find that the atomic positions at the planar defect are comparable to those of a free surface, revealing their role in phase stabilisation. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the RP planes are electronically benign, however, antisites observed at RP turning points are likely to be malign. We therefore propose that increasing RP planes while reducing RP turning points could offer a breakthrough for improving both phase stability and photophysical performance. The formation mechanism revealed here may well apply more generally to RP structures in other perovskite systems.
